MODELS FOR PARAMETERIZED DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS", submitted to SIAM journal on Scientific Computing.


The following functions are used to Construct reduced order model (ROM) for the numerical examples:

Burger_ROM.m: Burger equation 

Redi_ROM.m:  2d-reaction-diffusion equation

Redi_10d_ROM.m: 10-d reaction-diffusion equation

NS_ROM.m:  N-S equation


The following functions are used to develop adaptive parametric reduced order model (pROM) for the numerical examples :

Burger_Adaptive_ROM.m: Burger equation

Redi_Adaptive_ROM.m:  2-d reaction-diffusion equation

Redi_10d_Adaptive_ROM.m: 10-d reaction-diffusion equation

NS_Adaptive_ROM_GPR.m: N-S equation


The N-S equation is solved by the following code
